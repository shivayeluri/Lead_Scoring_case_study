# Lead_Scoring_case_study

PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
An X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

GOALS :

1. Developed a logistic regression model assigning lead scores (0 to 100) for targeted lead prioritization based on conversion likelihood.
2. Developed a logistic regression model assigning lead scores (0 to 100) for targeted lead prioritization based on conversion likelihood.
